    <h3>2. Make Your Game Unique</h3>
    <p>Create a backstory or choose a theme or style for your platformer. Then, keep adding on to your game and adding new features to make it better!</p>
    <h3>3. Publish your Project to Itch.io</h3>
    <p><a href="https://itch.io/" taraget="_blank">Itch.io</a> is a website for people to share and play video games. Make an account, export your game, and publish it. </p>
    <h3>4. Ship your Project and Share it</h3>
    <p>Share your amazing project in the #ship channel and the #athena-award channel. You can share the Itch.io link for your game with family, friends, and anyone else.</p>
